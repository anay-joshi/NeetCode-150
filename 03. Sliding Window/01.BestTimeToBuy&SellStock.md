# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Easy


You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104


```
Step by Step Algorithm
Initialize Variables:
Initialize buy_price to the first price in the list and profit to 0.
buy_price = prices[0]
profit = 0
Iterate Over Prices
Loop through each price starting from the second price (prices[1:]).
for p in prices[1:]:
Update Buy Price
If the current price (p) is less than the previously set buy_price, update buy_price to the current price. This ensures that we buy at the lowest price possible.
if buy_price > p:
    buy_price = p
Calculate Profit
Calculate the profit by subtracting the buy_price from the current price (p). Update profit to the maximum value between the current profit and the calculated profit. This ensures we keep track of the maximum profit throughout the iteration.
profit = max(profit, p - buy_price)
Return Maximum Profit
After the loop, return the final value of profit, which represents the maximum profit achievable from buying and selling stocks.
return profit
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buyPrice = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;

        for(int i=1; i<prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i]<buyPrice){
                buyPrice = prices[i];
            }
            profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i]-buyPrice);
        }

        return profit;
    }
}
```
