# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree
Medium


Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
 ```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10<sup>4</sup>].
- -2<sup>31</sup> <= Node.val <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1


# Validate Binary Search Tree

## Problem
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid
Binary Search Tree (BST).

A BST must satisfy:
- All values in the left subtree are strictly less than the node’s value.
- All values in the right subtree are strictly greater than the node’s value.
- Both left and right subtrees must also be valid BSTs.

---

## Key Insight
Checking only immediate children is not enough.

Instead, each node must satisfy a **valid value range**:
min < node.val < max


As we move:
- Left subtree → update upper bound
- Right subtree → update lower bound

This ensures global BST constraints are enforced.

---

## Optimized Approach (Range Validation - DFS)

- Start with range `(-∞, +∞)`
- At each node:
  - If it violates its allowed range → return false
  - Recurse left with updated upper bound
  - Recurse right with updated lower bound

Each node is visited once.

---

## Algorithm
1. Call recursive helper with bounds:
validate(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE)

2. If node is null → return true
3. If node.val violates bounds → return false
4. Recursively validate left and right subtrees
5. Return true if all validations pass

---

## Java Implementation

```java
class Solution {
 public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
     return validateTree(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE);
 }

 private boolean validateTree(TreeNode node, long min, long max) {
     if (node == null) return true;

     if (node.val <= min || node.val >= max) return false;

     return validateTree(node.left, min, node.val)
         && validateTree(node.right, node.val, max);
 }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(H), H : height of tree, recursive calls
```
