# [226. Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

 ```
Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```
```
Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

# Invert Binary Tree 🌳

**LeetCode #226**

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree and return its root.

---

## 🔍 Intuition

Inverting a binary tree means **swapping the left and right child of every node**.

Since each subtree is itself a binary tree, the same logic can be applied recursively to all nodes.

---

## 🧠 Approach 1: Recursive (DFS)

### Steps
1. If the current node is `null`, return `null`
2. Swap the left and right children
3. Recursively invert the left subtree
4. Recursively invert the right subtree
5. Return the root

### Complexity
- **Time:** `O(n)` — every node is visited once
- **Space:** `O(h)` — recursion stack (`h` = height of tree)

### Java Implementation
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }

        // Swap left and right children
        TreeNode temp = root.left;
        root.left = root.right;
        root.right = temp;

        // Recursively invert subtrees
        invertTree(root.left);
        invertTree(root.right);

        return root;
    }
}
