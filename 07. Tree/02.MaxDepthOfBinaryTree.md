# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```
```
Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree 🌳

**LeetCode #104**

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its **maximum depth**.

> **Maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## 💡 Intuition

The depth of a tree depends on the **deeper of its two subtrees**.

At each node:
depth = 1 + max(left subtree depth, right subtree depth)


- `1` → counts the current node
- `max(...)` → chooses the longest path

---

## 🧠 Recursive Approach (DFS)

### Steps
1. If the current node is `null`, return `0`
2. Recursively compute left subtree depth
3. Recursively compute right subtree depth
4. Return `1 + max(leftDepth, rightDepth)`

---

## ⏱ Complexity
- **Time:** `O(n)` — every node is visited once
- **Space:** `O(h)` — recursion stack (`h` = tree height)

---

## ☕ Java Implementation
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        int leftDepth = maxDepth(root.left);
        int rightDepth = maxDepth(root.right);

        return 1 + Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth);
    }
}
