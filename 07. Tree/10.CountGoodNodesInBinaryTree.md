# [1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/)
Medium

Share
Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
- Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].

# Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

## Problem
Given the root of a binary tree, a node `X` is considered **good** if on the path
from the root to `X`, there are no nodes with a value greater than `X`.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

---

## Key Insight
A node is **good** if its value is **greater than or equal to the maximum value**
seen so far on the path from the root to that node.

So instead of re-checking all ancestors for every node, we:
- Carry the **maximum value so far** during traversal
- Decide in constant time whether the current node is good

---

## Optimized Approach (DFS – Top Down)

- Perform a DFS traversal starting from the root
- Pass the maximum value seen so far along the path
- At each node:
  - If `node.val >= maxSoFar`, count it as a good node
  - Update `maxSoFar` for child calls

Each node is processed exactly once.

---

## Algorithm
1. Start DFS from the root with `maxSoFar = root.val`
2. At each node:
   - If node is null, return 0
   - Check if the node is good
   - Update `maxSoFar`
   - Recurse on left and right subtrees
3. Return the total count

---

## Java Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root, root.val);
    }

    private int dfs(TreeNode node, int maxSoFar) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        int count = node.val >= maxSoFar ? 1 : 0;
        maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, node.val);

        count += dfs(node.left, maxSoFar);
        count += dfs(node.right, maxSoFar);

        return count;
    }
}

```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(height)
```
