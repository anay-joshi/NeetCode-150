# 572. Subtree of Another Tree
Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false
 ```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
- The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- -104 <= root.val <= 104
- -104 <= subRoot.val <= 104

# Subtree of Another Tree (LeetCode 572)

## Problem
Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, determine whether `subRoot`
is a subtree of `root`.

A subtree of a binary tree is a tree that consists of a node in `root` and all of its descendants,
and has the same structure and node values as `subRoot`.

---

## Key Insight
`subRoot` is a subtree of `root` if **there exists any node in `root`** such that the tree
rooted at that node is **exactly the same** as `subRoot`.

This reduces the problem to:
- Traversing the main tree (`root`)
- At each node, checking **Same Tree** equality with `subRoot`

---

## Approach

### Two Responsibilities
1. **Traversal (`isSubtree`)**
   - Walk through every node in `root`
2. **Verification (`isSame`)**
   - Check whether two trees are exactly identical (structure + values)

---

## Algorithm
1. If `root` is `null`, return `false`.
2. If `isSame(root, subRoot)` is `true`, return `true`.
3. Otherwise, recursively search in:
   - `root.left`
   - `root.right`
4. If no match is found, return `false`.

---

## Java Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubtree(TreeNode root, TreeNode subRoot) {
        if (root == null) return false;

        if (isSame(root, subRoot)) return true;

        return isSubtree(root.left, subRoot)
            || isSubtree(root.right, subRoot);
    }

    private boolean isSame(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (p == null && q == null) return true;
        if (p == null || q == null) return false;
        if (p.val != q.val) return false;

        return isSame(p.left, q.left)
            && isSame(p.right, q.right);
    }
}

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N × M)

N = number of nodes in root

M = number of nodes in subRoot

Space Complexity: O(H)

Due to recursion stack (H = height of root)
