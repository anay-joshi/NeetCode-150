# 100. Same Tree
Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
 ```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -104 <= Node.val <= 104

# Same Tree (LeetCode 100)

## Problem
Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, check if they are the same.

Two binary trees are considered the same if:
- They have the same structure
- The values of corresponding nodes are equal

---

## Key Insight
Both trees must be compared **node by node in lockstep**.

At each step:
- If both nodes are `null`, they are identical.
- If only one is `null`, the structure differs.
- If values differ, the trees are not the same.
- Otherwise, recursively compare left and right subtrees.

The first mismatch immediately returns `false`.

---

## Approach (DFS)

- Perform a simultaneous DFS traversal on both trees.
- Compare structure and values at every corresponding node.
- Use recursion with early termination on mismatch.

This approach is already optimal.

---

## Algorithm
1. If both nodes are `null`, return `true`.
2. If one node is `null`, return `false`.
3. If node values differ, return `false`.
4. Recursively compare:
   - left subtrees
   - right subtrees
5. Return `true` only if all checks pass.

---

## Java Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (p == null && q == null) return true;
        if (p == null || q == null) return false;
        if (p.val != q.val) return false;

        return isSameTree(p.left, q.left)
            && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
    }
}


Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N)
Each node is visited once.

Space Complexity: O(H)
Due to recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree.
