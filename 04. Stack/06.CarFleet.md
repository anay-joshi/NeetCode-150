# 853. Car Fleet
Medium


There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is target miles away.

You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.
Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
 ```

Constraints:

- n == position.length == speed.length
- 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- 0 < target <= 10<sup>6</sup>
- 0 <= position[i] < target
- All the values of position are unique.
- 0 < speed[i] <= 10<sup>6</sup>

## Approach
```
Intuition
Calculate time to arrive at target.

Approach
We can simply calculate time to reach the target.

⭐️ Points

Formula is...

(target - position) / 2
If a car takes less time to reach the target than the car ahead of it, it will catch up and form a car fleet with the car in front. Conversely, if a car takes more time to reach the target than the car ahead, it won't catch up before the destination and will therefore form a new car fleet separate from the one ahead.

How do you keep car fleets?
To solve this problem, it's essential to keep track of each car fleet's arrival time and compare it with the fleet immediately ahead.

While data structures like hash maps could store information, a stack is particularly suitable here because it allows efficient access to the most recent fleet's arrival time for comparison.

By using a stack, we can calculate each car's time to reach the destination and, as we iterate through the cars, determine whether the current car will catch up to the fleet ahead or form a new fleet.
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {
        int n = position.length;
        
        int[][] cars = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cars[i][0] = position[i];
            cars[i][1] = speed[i];
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(cars, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[0], a[0]));
        
        Stack<Double> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for (int[] car : cars) {
            int pos = car[0];
            int spd = car[1];
            double timeTaken = (double)(target - pos) / spd;
            
            if (stack.isEmpty() || timeTaken > stack.peek()) {
                stack.push(timeTaken);
            }
        }
        
        return stack.size();       
    }
}

```
