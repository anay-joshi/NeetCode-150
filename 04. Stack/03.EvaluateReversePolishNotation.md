# 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
Medium


Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

Valid operators are +, -, *, and /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

Note that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```
Example 2:
```
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```
Example 3:
```
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= tokens.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].

```Summary
Initialize an empty stack.
Iterate through each token in the RPN expression:
If the token is an operator, pop the necessary number of operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
If the token is a number, push it onto the stack.
Return the result, which is the only element left in the stack after processing all tokens.
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (String c : tokens) {
            if (c.equals("+")) {
                stack.push(stack.pop() + stack.pop());
            } else if (c.equals("-")) {
                int second = stack.pop();
                int first = stack.pop();
                stack.push(first - second);
            } else if (c.equals("*")) {
                stack.push(stack.pop() * stack.pop());
            } else if (c.equals("/")) {
                int second = stack.pop();
                int first = stack.pop();
                stack.push(first / second);
            } else {
                stack.push(Integer.parseInt(c));
            }
        }

        return stack.peek();        
    }
}

```

## Comlexity Analysis
```
Time Complexity: O(N) -> traversing through all the tokens
Space Complexity: O(N) -> for the stack
```
