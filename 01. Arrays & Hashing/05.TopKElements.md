# 347. Top K Frequent Elements
Medium

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
 
Algorithm Steps:

Create a frequency table
Create a Max Heap and add all the distinct elements
Poll top k frequent elements off the Heap
Time & Space Complexity Analysis:

N = # of elements in the input array
D = # of distinct (unique) elements in the input array

Building the HashMap: O(N) time

Add all the N elements into the HashMap and add thier frequency
Building the Heap: O(D) time

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-of-building-a-heap/
^Here is a proof that shows that building a heap of N elements will take O(N) time
In our case we are building a heap of D elements = O(D) time
Poll K distinct elements from the Heap: O(K log D) time

There are D elements in the Heap and we call poll() K times = O(K log D) time
Total Time Complexity = O(K log D)
Total Space Complexity = O(D), this is the size of the heap.


### Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
```java

class Solution {
    public int[] topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
        for(int num:nums){
            m.put(num, m.getOrDefault(num,0)+1);
        }

        Queue<Integer>count = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b) -> m.get(b)-m.get(a));

        for(int key: m.keySet()){
            count.add(key);
        }

        int[] ans = new int[k];

        for(int i=0; i<k; i++){
            ans[i] = count.poll();
        }

        return ans;
    }
}

```
