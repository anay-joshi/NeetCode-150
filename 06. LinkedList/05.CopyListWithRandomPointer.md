# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer
Medium


A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

- `val: an integer representing Node.val`
- `random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.`

Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
 ```

Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 1000
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- `Node.random` is null or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

## Approach
```
- Step 1: Duplicate each node such that old1->new1->old2->new2 ...
- Step 2: Random pointer of new = Random pointer of old's next
- Step 3: Seperate the the nodes to form old1->old2.. & new1->new2..
```
# Copy Linked List with Random Pointer — Revision Notes

## Problem Essence
- Each node has:
  - `next` pointer (normal)
  - `random` pointer (can point anywhere or null)
- Goal: create a **deep copy**
  - Brand new nodes
  - `next` and `random` in copy must point **only to copied nodes**
  - No pointer in copy refers to original list

---

## Why It’s Tricky
- `random` pointer may point to a node:
  - ahead
  - behind
  - itself
  - or null
- You must know the **copied version of a node** before assigning `random`

---

## Core Insight
To fix random pointers, you need a way to map:

original node → copied node

yaml
Copy code

This can be done by:
- extra memory (HashMap), or
- structure manipulation (interleaving)

---

## Interleaving Approach (O(1) Space)

### Step 1: Interleave Copies
Insert each copied node right after its original:

A → B → C
↓
A → A' → B → B' → C → C'

yaml
Copy code

Now:
- copy of any node `X` is `X.next`

---

### Step 2: Assign Random Pointers
If:
X.random → Y

makefile
Copy code

Then:
X'.random → Y'

makefile
Copy code

Because:
X' = X.next
Y' = Y.next

arduino
Copy code

So random assignment becomes:
copy.random = original.random.next

yaml
Copy code

---

### Step 3: Separate the Lists
Restore original list and extract copied list:

Original: A → B → C
Copy: A' → B' → C'

yaml
Copy code

Both lists become independent.

---

## Complexity
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1) extra (excluding output list)

yaml
Copy code

---

## Common Mistakes
- Not creating new nodes (shallow copy)
- Forgetting to move pointer during separation
- Missing null checks on `random`
- Breaking original list while detaching

---

## One-Line Memory Hook
> “Interleave → use `random.next` → detach.”

## Solution
```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    int val;
    Node next;
    Node random;

    public Node(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
        this.random = null;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {

        if(head == null) return null;

        // first create copy nodes
        Node curr = head;

        while(curr!=null){
            Node newNode = new Node(curr.val);
            newNode.next = curr.next;
            curr.next = newNode;
            curr = curr.next.next;
        }

        // now assingn randoms

        curr = head;

        while(curr!=null){
            if(curr.random != null){
                curr.next.random = curr.random.next;
            }
            curr = curr.next.next;
        }

        // separate the lists

        curr = head;
        Node copyHead = curr.next;

        while(curr!=null){
            Node copy = curr.next;
            curr.next = copy.next;

            if(copy.next!=null){
                copy.next = copy.next.next;
            }
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        return copyHead;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N+2*N+N) ~ O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1), no extra memory is used (memory used is for new list only)
```
