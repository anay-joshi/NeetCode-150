# 141. Linked List Cycle
Easy


Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 ```

Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
- -10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

## Approach

# Linked List Cycle Detection — Brute vs Optimal

## Problem Summary
Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a cycle  
(i.e., a node can be reached again by following `next` pointers).

## Brute Force Approach (Hashing)

### Intuition 🧠
- If there is a cycle, **the same node will be visited more than once**.
- Track all visited nodes.
- Re-visiting a node ⇒ cycle exists.

### Steps
1. Create a `HashSet` to store visited nodes.
2. Traverse the list from `head`.
3. If current node is already in the set → return `true`.
4. If traversal ends (`null`) → return `false`.

### Complexity
- **Time:** `O(n)`
- **Space:** `O(n)`

### Notes 📝
- Simple and intuitive
- Uses extra memory
- Not optimal, but easy to implement

## Optimal Approach (Two Pointers / Floyd’s Algorithm)

### Intuition 🧠
- Use two pointers moving at different speeds.
- **Slow:** moves 1 step
- **Fast:** moves 2 steps
- In a cycle, fast will eventually **catch up** to slow.

### Steps
1. Initialize `slow` and `fast` at `head`.
2. Move `slow` by 1 and `fast` by 2.
3. If `slow == fast` → cycle exists.
4. If `fast` or `fast.next` becomes `null` → no cycle.

### Complexity
- **Time:** `O(n)`
- **Space:** `O(1)` ✅

### Notes 📝
- No extra memory
- Interview-preferred solution
- Requires understanding pointer movement

## Quick Comparison ⚡

| Approach | Time | Space | Extra Memory |
|--------|------|-------|--------------|
| Brute (HashSet) | O(n) | O(n) | Yes |
| Optimal (2 Pointers) | O(n) | O(1) | No |

---

## One-Line Takeaway ✨
- **Brute:** Detect repeated nodes using memory.
- **Optimal:** Detect cycles using pointer speed difference.

## Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        
        ListNode slow = head, fast=head;
        while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null){
            slow = slow .next;
            fast = fast.next.next;

            if(slow==fast) return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
