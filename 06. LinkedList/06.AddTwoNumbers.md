# 2. Add Two Numbers
Medium


You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 ```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Approach
```
- Three pointers, one for each given list and 3rd one for resultant list
- untill both the pointers pointing to given lists are null or carry > 0
  - add new node to the resultant list
```

# Add Two Numbers (Linked List) — Intuition & Revision Notes

## Problem Recap
You are given two **non-empty linked lists** representing two non-negative integers.  
- Digits are stored in **reverse order**.
- Each node contains a **single digit**.
- Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list (also in reverse order).

---

## Core Intuition 🧠

This problem is essentially **manual addition**, digit by digit — just like how we add numbers on paper.

### Key Observations
- Since digits are stored in **reverse order**, we can add from head to tail directly.
- We must keep track of a **carry**.
- The lists may be of **different lengths**.
- There may be a **final carry** after both lists end.

---

## Step-by-Step Thought Process

1. **Use a dummy node**
   - Simplifies result list handling.
   - Avoids edge cases when creating the head.

2. **Traverse both lists simultaneously**
   - Continue while:
     - `l1` is not null, OR
     - `l2` is not null, OR
     - `carry > 0`

3. **Extract values**
   - If a list is null, treat its value as `0`.

4. **Compute sum**
   - `sum = v1 + v2 + carry`
   - Current digit = `sum % 10`
   - New carry = `sum / 10`

5. **Create new node**
   - Append the digit to the result list.

6. **Move pointers**
   - Advance `l1`, `l2`, and result pointer safely.

7. **Return result**
   - Skip the dummy node.

## Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode res = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode curr1 = l1, curr2 = l2, curr3 = res;
        int carry = 0;
        while(curr1 != null || curr2 != null || carry > 0) {
            int v1 = curr1 == null ? 0 : curr1.val;
            int v2 = curr2 == null ? 0 : curr2.val;
            int sum = v1 + v2 + carry;
            carry = sum / 10;
            curr3.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
            curr3 = curr3.next;
            curr1 = curr1 == null ? curr1 : curr1.next;
            curr2 = curr2 == null ? curr2 : curr2.next;
        }

        return res.next;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(max(len(list1, list2))
- Space Complexity: O(max(len(list1, list2))
```
