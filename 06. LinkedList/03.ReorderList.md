# 143. Reorder List
Medium


You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
 ```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Approach
```
Approach and Theory
The solution can be broken down into three key steps:

Step 1: Splitting the List into Two Halves
Using the two-pointer technique, we can identify the middle of the list:

slow moves one step at a time.
fast moves two steps at a time.
When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the midpoint of the list.

Example:

Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
After splitting: 1 → 2 → 3 and 4 → 5
Step 2: Reversing the Second Half
Next, we reverse the second half of the list. Starting from the node after slow, we use a standard iterative reversal process to reverse the pointers.

Example:

Before reversing: 4 → 5
After reversing: 5 → 4
Step 3: Merging the Two Halves
Finally, we merge the two halves alternately:

Take a node from the first half, then a node from the reversed second half.
Repeat until all nodes are merged.
Example:

First half: 1 → 2 → 3
Reversed second half: 5 → 4
Merged: 1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.

 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}

class Solution {
    public void reorderList(ListNode head) {
        
        if(head==null) return;
        
        // split the list. find middle
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;

        while( fast!=null && fast.next!=null ){
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }

        // reverse the second half
        ListNode second = slow.next;
        slow.next = null;
        ListNode prev = null;

        while(second!=null){
            ListNode temp = second.next;
            second.next = prev;
            prev = second;
            second = temp;
        }

        // Merge the lists
        second = prev;
        ListNode first = head;

        while(second!=null){
            ListNode temp1 = first.next;
            ListNode temp2 = second.next;
            first.next = second;
            second.next = temp1;
            first = temp1;
            second = temp2;
        }

    }
}
